               Library of Effective GO routines

This is a Library of Effective GO routines (libEGO), a high performance 
implementation of Go rules and most popular algorithms used in computer Go. 


                       Installation

You will need:
 - git (version control system) 
 - cmake (cross-platform, open-source build system)

Checkout the source:
  git clone git://github.com/lukaszlew/libego.git  

Construct library and examples with your favorite compiler:
  export CXX=g++-4.2  # you may put it in your .bashrc
  ./build_release.sh  # cmake inside

Light playout benchmark:
  ./release_build/example/engine -b
  ./release_build/example/engine -b 1000

Run exemplary GTP engine:
  ./release_build/example/engine


It will first run commands from automagic.gtp in current directory.
For other commands just type "help".
